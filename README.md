## 📖 Project Description  

**LiotRAG** (from *Liotru*, the symbol of Catania, and *RAG*, Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a **cloud-native knowledge assistant** built on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) and powered by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).  

The system scrapes and indexes resources from the **Department of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Catania**, creating a **chatbot interface** that enables:  
- ⚡ **Fast access** to distributed information across departmental pages  
- 🔍 **RAG-based retrieval** for context-aware question answering  
- ☁️ **Scalable deployment** through Azure-native services  

By combining local cultural identity with cutting-edge AI, LiotRAG bridges **academic knowledge** with **next-generation user experiences**.
